# Radiation shield

3D model for the radiation shield.

The exterior is composed of multiple components should be glued together before deployment.

- radiation_shield_internal.scad: closing bottom lid that slides into the lid. An L-shaped bracket should be connected for mounting. Alternatively, the anchor can be 3D printed
- anchor.scad L-shaped mounting bracket that can be 3D printed. Alternatively, a metal
bracket can also be used to reduced overall printing time.
- radiation_shield_optimised.scad: radiation shield with hole for the light sensor

## Requirements

To create STL files to print, [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) is required.
